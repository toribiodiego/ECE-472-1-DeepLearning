> This repository contains the code for **ECE 472: Deep Learning**, a 3-credit graduate course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, providing comprehensive exposure to modern deep learning techniques and their applications.

## Deep Learning
**Course, Fall 2023**  
**Instructor:** Professor Chris Curro


### Overview

This course introduces students to deep learning concepts and methodologies, emphasizing practical understanding through computational exercises and project-based learning. The curriculum spans foundational topics such as regression, gradient descent, and multi-layer perceptrons, as well as advanced models including convolutional neural networks, transformers, neural ODEs, and diffusion models. Through a series of programming assignments, quizzes, and class discussions on seminal research papers, students develop both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience necessary for conducting innovative deep learning research and real-world problem-solving.



### Material

The primary reference for this course is [*Deep Learning*](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, providing essential foundations in:

- Neural networks and gradient-based learning
- Convolutional neural networks and related architectures
- Attention mechanisms and transformer models
- Advanced techniques such as diffusion models, neural ODEs, and fine-tuning strategies

Additionally, relevant research papers will be provided throughout the semester to deepen understanding and facilitate project work.
